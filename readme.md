Description:

In this CTF challenge, a participant is presented with a scenario where they have been given a file called "ciphertext.bin" which contains an AES-encrypted message encrypted using the CBC mode. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that provides strong encryption of data. The CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode is a block cipher mode that allows the encryption of a message in blocks of fixed size, and it uses an initialization vector (IV) to ensure that identical plaintext blocks are encrypted to different ciphertexts.

Vulnerability: 

The challenge is based on the known vulnerability of using weak or easily guessable IVs in AES encryption with CBC mode. In this challenge, the IV used for encryption is weak and predictable, making the encryption vulnerable to known-IV attacks.
Task: The participant's task is to decrypt the message and find the flag hidden within. The key used to encrypt the message is also provided, but it is the participant's responsibility to identify and exploit the known vulnerability in order to successfully decrypt the message and find the flag.

Difficulty: 

The difficulty of this challenge is easy. However, the participant will have to have a good understanding of AES encryption and CBC mode, as well as knowledge of known-IV attacks and how to exploit them in order to successfully decrypt the message and find the flag.

Scenario:

You are a cyber security agent and have been called in to crack an encrypted message that contains crucial information for a top-secret operation. The message was encrypted using the AES algorithm in CBC mode. The encryption key used is known to you, but the IV used during encryption is weak and predictable. Your mission is to decrypt the message and find the flag hidden within.
